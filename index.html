                <p>Debt settlement services are not for everyone. Our projections are derived from historical results and will vary based on the specific creditors you are enrolled with and the terms of your individual program. Successful program completion is contingent on various factors, including your ability to accumulate sufficient funds. We cannot assure you that your debts will be settled for a predetermined amount or percentage, nor can we guarantee a specific timeframe for resolution. We do not assume your debts, make monthly creditor payments, or offer advice on tax, bankruptcy, accounting, legal matters, or credit repair services. Availability of our services will vary by state, and our fees are subject to state-specific variations. It is advisable to consult with a tax professional regarding potential tax implications of debt resolution for less than the full balance.
